# expense-manager
A tiny app, that will be used to manage family expenses.

I would like to create a simple application for personal needs and at the same time to practice the best practices and patters when creating it.
The application is supposed to use .NET Core WebApi as a backend. Frontend is planned to be done with ReactJS and ASP.NET Core MVC.
